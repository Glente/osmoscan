# osmoscan
Analytic software for csv files from the Lorrca Osmoscan test

It runs in R Shiny and requires two applications:
•	R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) 
•	Rstudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 

After installing both of these, you can just run “app.R” and it should install all required packages (the first run takes longer to run).

Comments/suggestions are welcome!
